    <h1>Welcome to NoobWeb</h1>
    <p>Here you will learn the basics of web development.</p>
    <p>Let's start with HTML.</p>
    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.</p>
    <p>HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
    <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects, such as interactive forms, may be embedded into the rendered page.</p>
    <p>HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.</p>
    <p>HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>
    <p>HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages.</p>
    <p>Let's create a simple HTML document.</p>
    <p>Open a text editor and type the following code:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
            &lt;html&gt;
            &lt;head&gt;
                &lt;title&gt;Page Title&lt;/title&gt;
            &lt;/head&gt;
            &lt;body&gt;

            &lt;h1&gt;This is a Heading&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/body&gt;
            &lt;/html&gt;
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>Save the file as <code>index.html</code> and open it in a web browser.</p>
    <p>You should see a heading and a paragraph displayed on the page.</p>
    <p>That's it for now.
